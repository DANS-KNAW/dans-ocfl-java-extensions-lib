/**
 * An implementation of FileStore that stores files and directories as a stack of layers. A layer can be staged or archived. Staged layers can be modified, archived layers are read-only. To transform
 * the layered file store into a regular file system directory, each layer must be unarchived (if it was archived) to a staging directory and the staging directories must be copied into a single
 * directory, starting with the oldest layer and ending with the newest layer. Files in newer layers overwrite files in older layers.
 *
 * The LayeredFileStore is backed by a LayerDatabase to support storage of layers in a way that may not be fast enough for direct access, for example on tape. See the LayerDatabase interface for more
 * information.
